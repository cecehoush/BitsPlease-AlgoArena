<h2><strong>Project Idea:</strong></h2> </p>
<p>
<em> Leetcode school and class-based </em>
    <ul>     
    <li> Algorithm visualizer </li>
    <li> Msu based with class subcategories </li>
    <li> Focuses on class material being learned </li>
    <li> Theme it as the code being a challenger </li>
    <li> Prompt: ___ coding challenges defeated </li> 
    </ul>

</p>
<p>
<h3><strong>Main Idea:</strong></h3> Normal User logs in, list of CS classes, go to a class, in classes thereâ€™s a list of coding practice problems, in a problem create an answer and submit, once submitted user can look at a solution that could work and to the right would be algorithm visualizer. 
    * Could have Normal user (student), administrator user (leader) that posts solutions and can delete, and professor user (teacher) can log on and post their answers. Students can pick the professors to see what their answer is.

    <li> Add something to do with the points received (Leaderboard? Rewards?) </li>
    <li> Make professors answers to challenges viewable </li>
    <li> confetti when the users solution to challenge is correct </li>
    <li> Make admins able to add Example Code </li>
    <li> For completed: </li>
    <ul>
        <li> percent completion </li>
        <li> attempts/time taken </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Tutor links/professor feedback </li>
    <li> If you fail 3+ attempts, it recommends an easier or similar problem </li>
    <li> Be able to view what you've submitted in 'views' </li>
    <li> Once finished with a challenge, unpin it from favorites </li>
</ul>
