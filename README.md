# BitsPlease-AlgoArena
MSU and DU Hackathon
Team name: Bits Please 
Team members: Cece Housh, Vincent Cordova, and Danny Vo
Algorithm Visualizer name: DigitalDive

Project Idea:
Leetcode school and class-based 
    - Algorithm visualizer (on the side if we have time)
    * Msu based with class subcategories 
    * Focuses on class material being learned 
    * Theme it as the code being a challenger 
    * Prompt: ___ coding challenges defeated 

Main idea: Normal User logs in, list of CS classes, go to a class, in classes thereâ€™s a list of coding practice problems, in a problem create an answer and submit, once submitted user can look at a solution that could work and to the right would be algorithm visualizer. 
    * Could have Normal user (student), administrator user (leader) that posts solutions and can delete, and professor user (teacher) can log on and post their answers. Students can pick the professors to see what their answer is. 
    
Embellishments: 
- limit to favorites
- weekly coding events (Arena)
- badges/ranking system (points for challenges
- For completed:
      - percent completion
      - attempts/time taken
- Tutor links/professor feedback
