<h2><strong>Project Idea:</strong></h2> </p>
<p>
<em> Leetcode school and class-based </em>
    <ul>     
    <li> Algorithm visualizer (on the side if we have time) </li>
    <li> Msu based with class subcategories </li>
    <li> Focuses on class material being learned </li>
    <li> Theme it as the code being a challenger </li>
    <li> Prompt: ___ coding challenges defeated </li> 
    </ul>

</p>
<p>
<h3><strong>Main Idea:</strong></h3> Normal User logs in, list of CS classes, go to a class, in classes thereâ€™s a list of coding practice problems, in a problem create an answer and submit, once submitted user can look at a solution that could work and to the right would be algorithm visualizer. 
    * Could have Normal user (student), administrator user (leader) that posts solutions and can delete, and professor user (teacher) can log on and post their answers. Students can pick the professors to see what their answer is.

<strong>Embellishments</strong>: 
<ul>
* Add a limit to favorites (max of 10)
* Add UserProfile in top right hand corner for easy access back to profile (home page)
* Adding titles <span>&#10003;</span>
* Make titles include the course name for challenges and the user name for profile <span>&#10003;</span>
* Add a logo on the top left <span>&#10003;</span>
* Make the checkboxes hearts to symbolize 'favorites' <span>&#10003;</span>
* Weekly coding events (Arena)
* Badges/ranking system (points for challenges
* For completed:
    <ul>
        <li> percent completion </li>
        <li> attempts/time taken </li>
    </ul>
* Tutor links/professor feedback
* If you fail 3+ attempts, it recommends an easier or similar problem
* Add code to completed challenge, so you can view what you've submitted
* Once finished with challenge, unpin it from favorites
</ul>
